## Example Grading

We will compute grades from a weighted average, as follows:

- Homeworks: 10% (equally weighted)
- Project 1: 10%
- Project 2: 20%
- Project 3: 10%
- Midterm: 20%
- Final: 30%

The class as a whole has been, and will continue to be, adjusted to match the [department guidelines](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad) for upper-division CS classes. Previous grade distributions on [Berkeleytime](https://berkeleytime.com/grades) are also good indicators of the curve.

Please treat these grade bins as tentative and flexible to provide you an idea of what your minimum potential grade is, meaning they could be shifted down in order to meet the department guidelines. There’s no guarantee that bins will be shifted, and we do not know whether they will be shifted until after the final exam (so don’t ask). Bins will not shift up; for example, if you have a 90 in the course, you are guaranteed at least an A. To be transparent, these bins have been artificially inflated to be higher than historical grade distributions for this course to provide you an idea of what your minimum potential grade is. These bins should give you a rough idea of where you are in the course, but they are not a universal truth.

These bins are only guaranteed for students who complete all three projects (or have approval to miss a project). To complete a project is to score at least 50% on the entire project (including the writeup). Grades are at course staff's discretion for anyone who fails to complete any project (without explicit approval).
