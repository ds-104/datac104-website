# Where should we start automatically numbering each column?
# For example, if you set starting_homework_number to 0, then the first homework
# assignment you create is numbered HW0. If you set it to 1, then that same
# assignment is numbered HW1 instead.
starting_lecture_number: '1'
starting_readings_number: '1'
starting_discussion_number: '0'
starting_homework_number: '1'
starting_project_number: '1'
# Is the first week of class Week 0 or Week 1? We currently don't support
# starting at any other week number, so pick '0' or '1' here.
starting_week_number: '1'

# How many rows should each assignment take up by default?
# We have one lecture per row. Highly unlikely you'll need to change this.
default_lecture_rowspan: '1'
default_readings_rowspan: '1'
# This probably corresponds to how many rows you have per week, assuming
# you hold discussion once per week. For example, if you have Tu/Th classes
# (two rows per week), then your discussion boxes are probably going to
# take up two rows most of the time, so you'd set default_discussion_rowspan='2'.
# If you have M/W/F classes, though, this might be '3' instead.
default_discussion_rowspan: '1'
# Similar reasoning to discussion, assuming your homeworks are weekly.
default_homework_rowspan: '1'
# Project rowspans are too variable, so we just set the default to 1 and
# never use the default (always manually specifying the rowspan).
default_project_rowspan: '1'

default_objectives_rowspan: '3'
default_week_rowspan: '3'
