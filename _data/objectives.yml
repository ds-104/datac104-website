  - title: "We introduce one of the driving questions of our class: how can we see data as not just a tool that can be used for good or bad purposes, but as a way in which we make social order? We read Langdon Winner’s classic text, “Do Artifacts Have Politics,” which shows how even the most mundane technologies have political authority, organize human social relationships, and favor particular political systems. Along the way, we introduce the HCE Toolkit, a set of analytical concepts that help make sense of how science and technology interact with social order. We practice applying these concepts both to simple technologies like bridges and to contemporary price-fixing rent algorithms."
