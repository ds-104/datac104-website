# - Google Calendar events should all be prefixed "[CS101 SP25]" so that students
#   adding it to their calendar see "[CS101 SP25] Lecture" instead of just "Lecture".
# - But, on the website itself, students should just see "Lecture" instead of
#   "[CS101 SP25]" in front of all the calendar events, to avoid clutter.
# - Put the common prefix here so that the JS in calendar.html will remove the prefix
#   when rendering the website.
# - Note the trailing space is included here too, so that "[CS101 SP25] Lecture"
#   becomes "Lecture", not " Lecture".
remove_prefix: "[CS101 SP25] "

# When making your calendar, please title your events as follows (this is for color coding):
# - OH: Include "Office Hours" in the name
# - Lecture: Include "Lecture" in the name
# - Discussion: Include "Discussion" in the name
#   - If you have special discussion names, we've also created different coloring for
#     - Bridge
#     - Exam Prep
# - Project Party: Include "Project" and "Party" in the name (for instance, "Project 1 Party" works)
# - Exam: Include "Exam", "Quest", "Midterm", "MT", or "Final" in the name
# - Review Session: Include "Review Session" in the name
