## What is the HCE Toolkit?
A set of concepts and methods from Science, Technology, and Society (STS) and History selected to build understanding of the datafied world, helping students to identify where human power structures and value choices get built into technical work, and empowering them to discover how, when, and where they can responsibly and effectively intervene.

## About using the Toolkit
Using the HCE Toolkit is a constructive project — it's useful for offering ways forward (not just critiquing or dismantling what others think). It's pedagogical and ethical aim is to together engage in responsibly making worlds with technologies. Try it on new cases, including in relation to other technologies.

Use of the Toolkit requires your life experiences, identities, values, devotions, frustrations...

## Tools

- Theories that describe how technology and society relate.
- Elements of social life that undergo transformation and are salient in defining technological design, use, and forms of life in the datafied world.

    <p>Asking about labor helps us look to sociotechnical processes of production, working conditions, and how labor is differentially valorized, exploited, and structured in various historical and sociotechnical contexts.</p>

    <p>Labor is also a social agent - “organized labor” can be a political force that shapes the conditions under which labor takes place</p>
